This is a demo made for tracking pedestrian as I am making an attempt to track other vehicles. Starting out the problem with pedestrian is somewhat easier since their motions are more predictable. Click [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYgb9e5i_JM) for the demo video.

This Project uses OpenCV 3.1.0 and Python. The video source video can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7mbo35zrxd1aefz/peopleCounter.avi?dl=0)

Thanks Federico E. Mej√≠a Barajas for his invaluable advices. I recommend looking at his [tutorial](http://www.femb.com.mx/blog/) and going through documentations on the OpenCV Python tutorial side to understand the code.
